# Early Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the early detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost algorithm. Early detection of CKD is crucial for timely medical intervention and can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project leverages advanced data analysis and machine learning to predict the likelihood of CKD in patients based on various health indicators.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various health-related parameters such as age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, sugar levels, and other relevant medical attributes. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and other anomalies to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the model.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalizing numerical features

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Identifying the most relevant features for prediction

3. **Model Training**:
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   - Training the XGBoost model on the training set

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

## Model

The XGBoost algorithm was chosen for its efficiency and accuracy in handling large datasets and its ability to model complex relationships. XGBoost is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve prediction accuracy.

## Results

The XGBoost model achieved high accuracy and demonstrated robust performance in predicting CKD.
